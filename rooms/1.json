"description": "You move toward the door, you try to budge the door.
The door creaks open immediately and swings open to the hallway.
You walk out into the hallway. Directly in front of you is
a wall holding a gothic sconce drenched in wax. The flame is dim and provides
just enough light for you to see in front of you.",
