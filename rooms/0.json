"description": "You find yourself in a damp room shrouded in thick and
motionless darkness. You can see but a single sliver of golden light gleaming
through a small crack in what must be the door in front of you. You notice that
the ground is very moist and you are not wearing any clothes. Your hands are
bound tightly behind your back with some type of rope.",
